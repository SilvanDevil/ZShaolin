ZShaolin bootstrap short instructions

Use crosstools-ng to bootstrap ZShaolin's toolchain

1) download crosstools-ng from http://crosstool-ng.org

2) install crosstools-ng

3) inside this bootstrap directory, do:
   ct-ng menuconfig
   (tweak at your own risk, default is tested for Android ARM)

4) start building with:
   ct-ng build

Be warned: the bootstrap takes a long while, uses your CPU heavily
and occupies approx 3 Gigabytes on your harddisk.

May the source be with you!
